# scraper

Scraper is a full-stack app that scrapes articles from the Fantasy Flight Games homepage using the npm packages Cheerio and Request. That information is stored in a MongoDB database using the Mongoose npm package. The schema for the data is setup in such a way that duplicates cannot be stored in the database. The data from the database is retrieved through a custom built server using Node.js and Express. Finally, the data is dynamically rendered to the page using the Handlebars npm package. The user can read articles through links that are dynamically generated on the page (once again, utilizing Express and Handlebars). Finally, users can also leave comments on each article, as well as delete comments made on each article, with the database once again being updated.
